<!-- This page will be the first of my bigger projects.
I intend on making a more fun version for my person use 
and a more sfw edition for my github.

TODOpage will have two main funtions:
1) There will be a page that will allow for text input
which is intended as a single session TODO list. 
Features that must be included are:
    a) prioritization of some tasks over others
    b) mutability/the ability to add and remove tasks
    c) the ability to check off tasks that have been completed
Potential features that I could eventually add on are:
    a) A timer that either counts up or down or both
2) There will be a page that randomly chooses a project to work on
Features that must be included are:
    a) The ability to add or remove projects to be included
    b) A reroll option
Potential deatures that I could eventually add on are:
    a) A wheel that contains all of the projects and spins at a random rate

I will initially prioritize the functionality of the site and then rework the css 
to add usability and aesthetics.-->
